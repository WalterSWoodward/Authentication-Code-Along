// Class Question: Why don't you just run `yarn nodemon server.js` in the command line?
// Luis' Answer:  You could do this.  You would have to be sure that you installed nodemon globally though.
// As it is, you just install nodemon as a dev dependency and then type in the script 'start' command,
// and then you can just type `yarn start` to start your server.  Doing it this way means that you do
// not need to have nodemon globally installed on your system.
